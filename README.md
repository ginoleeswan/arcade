> **Where this project is heading:** ARCADE (2021) is being resurrected and
> evolved into **Respec** — an app for time-poor gamers that answers _"what can
> I actually finish?"_ The full product spec lives in
> [`docs/PRODUCT.md`](./docs/PRODUCT.md), and validation work in
> [`docs/validation/`](./docs/validation/). This README covers the current
> codebase: a modernised version of the original game-discovery app.

## Stack

- [Expo SDK 57](https://docs.expo.dev/) / React Native 0.86 / React 19
- TypeScript (strict) · [expo-router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) file-based navigation
- ESLint + Prettier · CI via GitHub Actions
- [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/apidocs) for game data

## Get started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ginoleeswan/sidequest
cd sidequest
npm install

# API key (free): https://rawg.io/apidocs
cp .env.example .env   # then paste your key in

npx expo start
```

Open in [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), an emulator, or press `w` for web.

### Scripts

| Command                              |                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run typecheck`                  | TypeScript, no emit                                    |
| `npm run lint`                       | ESLint                                                 |
| `npm run format`                     | Prettier write                                         |
| `npm test`                           | Jest (unit and component)                              |
| `npm run test:coverage`              | the same, against the coverage floor CI enforces       |
| `npm run test:hydration`             | builds nothing — runs `e2e/hydration.mjs` over `dist/` |
| `npm run test:a11y`                  | axe (WCAG A/AA) over `dist/`, both widths              |
| `npm run test:icons`                 | every named icon draws from the subset font            |
| `npm run test:data`                  | data-full screens say the sentences a reader acts on   |
| `npm run test:perf`                  | 4G + 4x CPU: bytes, FCP, LCP, CLS against budgets      |
| `npm run shots:ipad`                 | every screen at every iPad size, as PNGs (see below)   |
| `npm run test:live`                  | sync against a real Supabase project (see below)       |
| `npm run build`                      | sitemap + static web export into `dist/`               |
| `node scripts/subset-icons.mjs`      | regenerate the Ionicons subset (after adding an icon)  |
| `node scripts/duration-coverage.mjs` | data-source validation (see `docs/validation/`)        |
| `node scripts/brand-assets.mjs`      | regenerate icons, splash and OG card from the mark     |

EAS lives in its own scripts — `build:dev` / `build:preview` / `build:prod`
and `update:preview` / `update:prod` — plus `npm run prebuild` for the
native projects. `scripts/brand-assets.mjs` also writes the splash
wordmark that `plugins/withSplashWordmark` patches into the iOS
storyboard, which is why the two share their size constants.

`test:hydration` and `test:a11y` need a `dist/` from `npm run build`, and a Chromium that
Playwright can launch. Where the installed browser does not match the
Playwright build (a sandbox with its own browsers, say), point at it:

```bash
CHROMIUM_PATH=/path/to/chrome npm run test:hydration
```

`test:live` is the only suite that talks to a real database, and it is
deliberately outside `npm test` and outside CI. Everything else about
sync runs against a backend we wrote ourselves, which proves the engine
agrees with our understanding of Postgres rather than with Postgres — an
upsert whose conflict target misses the index, a policy that refuses the
anon role, a trigger that never fires: none of those can fail against a
fake. This one signs in and drives real rounds through PostgREST as two
devices, including a conflict, a delete and a row the server refuses.

It writes rows and deletes them again, but it is still somebody's
database, so point it at a throwaway account:

```bash
SIDEQUEST_LIVE_URL=https://<ref>.supabase.co \
SIDEQUEST_LIVE_KEY=<publishable key> \
SIDEQUEST_LIVE_EMAIL=<throwaway user> \
SIDEQUEST_LIVE_PASSWORD=<their password> \
npm run test:live
```

It runs on plain Node rather than the app's jest preset, which matters:
jest-expo installs React Native's `fetch`, and in a test process that is
a stub which resolves with no status and no body — a suite that cannot
reach the network while looking like it did.

`shots:ipad` is the iPad review without a Mac: it renders the export at
every iPad size Apple sells, portrait and landscape, and writes a
screenshot per screen for a person to look at. Native gives a tablet the
wide layout without the web's sidebar, so the export has to be built the
same way:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_PREVIEW_TABLET=1 npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist-ipad
npm run shots:ipad     # → e2e/ipad-shots/<size>/<screen>.png
```

## Deploy (Vercel)

The web build is a static export — `vercel.json` is already configured.

1. Import the repo at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) (framework
   preset: **Other** — `vercel.json` supplies the build command and output
   directory).
2. Add environment variables in the project settings:
   - `RAWG_API_KEY` = your RAWG key. Server-side only (used by
     `api/rawg-proxy.ts` and `api/preview.ts`) — kept out of every
     client bundle. Web and native both call RAWG through this proxy,
     which answers from the edge cache; a native build only needs
     `EXPO_PUBLIC_RAWG_API_KEY` (with `EXPO_PUBLIC_RAWG_DIRECT=1`) if
     it should bypass the deployment and call RAWG itself.
   - `STEAM_API_KEY` = your Steam Web API key
     ([steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)) —
     powers Steam connect on The Plan. Server-side only (used by
     `api/steam.ts`), never shipped to the browser. Optional: without it,
     Steam connect shows a friendly "not configured" message.
   - `STEAMGRIDDB_API_KEY` = a SteamGridDB key
     ([steamgriddb.com/profile/preferences/api](https://www.steamgriddb.com/profile/preferences/api)) —
     the publishers' own artwork: title logos over the art, the wide
     heroes behind them on the desk, box art where IGDB has none, and
     the square marks on the plan's rows. Server-side only (used by
     `api/art.ts`). Optional: without it, the same come from Steam's CDN
     for games with a Steam release, and the rest draw from RAWG.
   - `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID` and `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET` = a Twitch application
     ([dev.twitch.tv/console/apps](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)) —
     IGDB authenticates through Twitch, and these power the reported
     time-to-beat figures the plan is built on. Server-side only (used by
     `api/igdb.ts`). Optional: without them every length falls back to
     RAWG's average, which is the behaviour before they are set.
3. Deploy. Dynamic game pages (`/game/123`) are served via the rewrite in
   `vercel.json`.
4. Universal links come with it: `public/apple-app-site-association.json`
   is served at `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`, so a game or
   plan link opens the installed iOS app. The file names every build
   variant's bundle id under the team in `app.json`; a new variant needs
   a line there, and `src/lib/__tests__/universalLinks.test.ts` checks
   the two agree.

Or from the CLI: `npx vercel --prod` (after `npx vercel env add RAWG_API_KEY`).

## App Store

Everything the iOS submission needs is under [`docs/app-store/`](./docs/app-store/):
the audit and runbook (`SUBMISSION.md`), every listing field with the
App Privacy and age-rating answers (`listing.md`), and the EAS Metadata
file (`store.config.json`) that `eas metadata:push` reads.
`scripts/store-screenshots.sh` captures the store screenshots from the
simulator.
